I'm a hobbyist programmer who works on various kinds of projects in my spare time.

I have most experience in Python, Java, C++ and Typescript, however I am always open to learning more.

Right now I'm mainly working as the programming lead of a robotics team on our Java-based robot and Typescript-based applications, and working with Python/C++ on side projects.
