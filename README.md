I'm a hobbyist programmer who works on various kinds of projects in my spare time.

I have most experience in Python, Java, and C++, however I am always open to learning more.

Right now I'm mainly working as a member of a robotics team on our new Java-based robot, and working with Python/C++ on side projects.
